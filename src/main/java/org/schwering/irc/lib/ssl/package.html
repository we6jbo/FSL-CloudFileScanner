Provides support for secure IRC connections.
<p>
The {@link org.schwering.irc.lib.ssl.SSLIRCConnection} firstly tries to 
use the <code>javax.net.ssl.*</code> classes which were added in J2SE 1.4.
If this fails, it tries to load the classes of the JSSE library (from the 
packages <code>javax.net.ssl.*</code> and <code>com.sun.net.ssl.*</code>).
